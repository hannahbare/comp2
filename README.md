# comp2
Module 1 static comp 2. Topic is to create a website that displays artwork of a painter.
Challenges: At first I had a few challenges using HTML wrapping to my advantage. It was good practice to do it a couple of times and figure out what worked best.

Win: I feel excited about how I was able to use grid in my static comp as well as styling it how I wanted. This was a fun and exciting project for me.

Color Palette: For this composition I wanted to choose colors that could compliment the artwork while also giving representation to the artist herself. Earthy tones were chosen to be most representative of this.
